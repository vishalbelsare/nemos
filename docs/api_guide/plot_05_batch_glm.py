# Batching example

Here we demonstrate how to setup and run a stochastic gradient descent in `nemos`
by batching and using the `update` method of the model class.

# ## Simulate data
# 
# Let's generate some data artificially

# ## Model configuration
#
# Let's imagine this dataset do not fit in memory. We can use a batching approach to train the GLM.
# First we need to instantiate the `PopulationGLM`. The default algorithm for `PopulationGLM` is gradient descent.
# We suggest to use it for batching.
#
# !!! Note
#     You must shutdown the dynamic update of the step for fitting a batched (also called stochastic) gradient descent.
#     In jaxopt, this can be done by setting the parameters `acceleration` to False and setting the `stepsize`.
#

# ## Basis instantiation
#
# Here we instantiate the basis. `ws` is 40 time bins. It corresponds to a 200 ms windows
ws = 40
basis = nmo.basis.RaisedCosineBasisLog(5, mode="conv", window_size=ws)

# %%
# ## Batch definition
#
# The batch size needs to be larger than the window size of the convolution kernel defined above.
batch_size = 5  # second


# %%
# Here we define a batcher function that generate a random 5 s of design matrix and spike counts.
# This function will be called during each iteration of the stochastic gradient descent.
def batcher():
	# Grab a random time within the time support. Here is the time support is one epoch only so it's easy.
	t = np.random.uniform(units.time_support[0, 0], units.time_support[0, 1]-batch_size)

	# Bin the spike train in a 1s batch
	ep = nap.IntervalSet(t, t+batch_size)
	counts = units.restrict(ep).count(0.005)  # count in 5 ms bins

	# Convolve
	X = basis.compute_features(counts)

	# Return X and counts
	return X, counts


# %%
# ## Solver initialization
# 
# First we need to initialize the gradient descent solver within the `PopulationGLM`.
# This gets you the initial parameters and the first state of the solver.
params, state = glm.initialize_solver(*batcher())

# %%
# ## Batch learning
#
# Let's do a few iterations of gradient descent calling the `batcher` function at every step.
# At each step, we store the log-likelihood of the model for each neuron evaluated on the batch
n_step = 500
logl = np.zeros(n_step)

for i in range(n_step):	

	# Get a batch of data
	X, Y = batcher()

	# Do one step of gradient descent.
	params, state = glm.update(params, state, X, Y)

	# Score the model along the time axis
	logl[i] = glm.score(X, Y, score_type="log-likelihood")


# %%
#
# !!! Warning "Input validation"
# 	  The `update` method does not perform input validation each time it is called.
#     This design choice speeds up computation by avoiding repetitive checks. However,
#     it requires that all inputs to the `update` method strictly conform to the expected
#     dimensionality and structure as established during the initialization of the solver.
#     Failure to comply with these expectations will likely result in runtime errors or
#     incorrect computations.
#
# First let's plot the log-likelihood to see if the model is converging.

# %%
# We can see that the log-likelihood is increasing but did not reach plateau yet.
# The number of iterations can be increased to continue learning.
# 
# We can take a look at the coefficients.
# Here we extract the weight matrix of shape `(n_neurons*n_basis, n_neurons)`
# and reshape it to `(n_neurons, n_basis, n_neurons)`.
# We then average along basis to get a weight matrix of shape `(n_neurons, n_neurons)`.
