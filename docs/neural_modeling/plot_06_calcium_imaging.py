Fit Calcium Imaging
============


For the example dataset, we will be working with a recording of a freely-moving mouse imaged with a Miniscope (1-photon imaging at 30Hz using the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f). The area recorded for this experiment is the postsubiculum - a region that is known to contain head-direction cells, or cells that fire when the animal's head is pointing in a specific direction.

The data were collected by Sofia Skromne Carrasco from the [Peyrache Lab](https://www.peyrachelab.com/).

# There are a few different ways we can explore the data. First, let's inspect the raw calcium traces for neurons 4 and 35 for the first 250 seconds of the experiment.

# %%
# You can see that the calcium signals are both nonnegative, and noisy. One (neuron 4) has much higher SNR than the other. We cannot typically resolve individual action potentials, but instead see slow calcium fluctuations that result from an unknown underlying electrical signal (estimating the spikes from calcium traces is known as _deconvolution_ and is beyond the scope of this demo). 

# %%
# We can also plot tuning curves, plotting mean calcium activity as a function of head direction, using the function `compute_1d_tuning_curves_continuous`.
# Here `data['ry']` is a `Tsd` that contains the angular head-direction of the animal between 0 and 2$\pi$.

tcurves = nap.compute_1d_tuning_curves_continuous(transients, data['ry'], 120)

# ## Basis instantiation
# 
# We can define a cyclic-BSpline for capturing the encoding of the heading angle, and a log-spaced raised cosine basis for the coupling filters between neurons. Note that we are not including a self-coupling (spike history) filter, because in practice we have found it results in overfitting.
#
# We can combine the two bases.

# %%
# ## Gamma GLM
#
# Until now, we have been modeling spike trains, and have used a Poisson distribution for the observation model. With calcium traces, things are quite different: we no longer have counts but continuous signals, so the Poisson assumption is no longer appropriate. A Gaussian model is also not ideal since the calcium traces are non-negative. To satisfy these constraints, we will use a Gamma distribution from NeMoS with a soft-plus non linearity.
# !!! note "Non-linearity"
#     Different option are possible. With a soft-plus we are assuming an "additive" effect of the predictors, while an exponential non-linearity assumes multiplicative effects. Deciding which firing rate model works best is an empirical question. You can fit different configurations to see which one capture best the neural activity.

# ## Train & test set

# %%
# Unfortunately scikit-learn has not adopted pynapple yet. Let's convert `ylreg` to a pynapple object to make our life easier.

# While there is some variability in the fit for both models, one advantage of the gamma distribution is clear: the nonnegativity constraint is followed with the data. 
#  This is required for using GLMs to predict the firing rate, which must be positive, in response to simulated inputs. See Peyrache et al. 2018[^1] for an example of simulating activity with a GLM.

# Another way to compare models is to compute tuning curves. Here we use the function `compute_1d_tuning_curves_continuous` from pynapple.

# !!! note "Gamma-GLM for Calcium Imaging Analysis"
#     Using Gamma-GLMs for fitting calcium imaging data is still in early stages, and hasn't been through
#     the levels of review and validation that they have for fitting spike data. Users should consider
#     this a relatively unexplored territory, and we hope that we hope that NeMoS will help researchers
#     explore this new space of models.
